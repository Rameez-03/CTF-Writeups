# 🛡️ CTF Writeups

A collection of my Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups, covering vulnerability analysis, exploitation steps, methodology, and lessons learned.  
This repository documents my learning journey across platforms such as **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, and other CTF challenges.

Each writeup is structured to follow a professional penetration-testing flow:  
**Recon → Enumeration → Exploitation → Privilege Escalation → Post-Exploitation → Flags**

## 📘 Completed Writeups

### ✔️ TryHackMe — Blue
A beginner-level Windows machine vulnerable to **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)**, exploited to gain SYSTEM-level access.  
👉 **Writeup:** [Blue/README.md](./Blue/README.md)

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Track and document my progress in cybersecurity  
- Build professional-quality CTF writeups suitable for a portfolio  
- Develop clear, consistent reporting habits similar to real-world penetration test reports  
- Improve methodology, reasoning, and exploit execution over time  
- Provide clean references for revisiting techniques later  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Covered

Common techniques you will find across writeups:

- **Network Enumeration:** `nmap`, service discovery, version detection  
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** CVE research, manual validation  
- **Exploitation:** Metasploit, manual payload execution  
- **Privilege Escalation:** Windows & Linux priv-esc methods  
- **Post-Exploitation:** Hash dumping, credential cracking  
- **Documentation:** Structured reporting & explanation of steps

## 📌 Future Rooms (Planned)

- TryHackMe: *Ice*, *Kenobi*, *Steel Mountain*  
- Hack The Box: *Lame*, *Legacy*, *Shocker*  
- Additional Windows & Linux privilege escalation labs  
*(and more as I progress)*
